This package contains production tools for creating and managing Mu2e job definitions,
FCL files, and production workflows. It provides Python-based tools that replace and
extend the functionality of the original Perl-based mu2ejobtools.

Main tools:
- json2jobdef: Create job definition tarballs from JSON configurations
- fcldump: Generate FCL files from job definitions, datasets, or target files
- runjobdef: Execute production jobs based on job definitions
- datasetFileList: List files in Mu2e datasets using SAM

Before using these tools, you need to setup the mu2e package and FHICL_FILE_PATH
environment variable. This is usually accomplished by setting up Mu2e Offline.

Usage:
  ups setup prodtools
  # or
  source /cvmfs/mu2e.opensciencegrid.org/artexternals/prodtools/setup.sh
